    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the globalisation of the NBA by analysing advanced statistics, player distribution, and trends over time. Using advanced metrics, each player is assigned a composite score to quantify their performance for a given season. By filtering for the top 10 NBA players over the past three seasons based on this composite score, this study aims to evaluate whether globalisation is permeating the league’s elite ranks. Furthermore, this project examines player distributions by nationality over the same period to assess the broader impact of globalisation on the league.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions:**\n",
    "1. Who are the top 10 players in the NBA based on performance over the past three seasons?\n",
    "2. How has the distribution of NBA players by nationality evolved over the same period?\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis leverages data from two primary sources:\n",
    "- **[Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com):** A widely respected resource for historical and current NBA data, providing comprehensive player statistics and advanced metrics.\n",
    "- **[NBA API](https://developer.nba.com/):** An official source of real-time league data, offering up-to-date player metrics and team statistics for robust and accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these questions and trends, this study seeks to uncover whether the influx of international players is reshaping the league and determine if these players are competing at the highest levels of basketball excellence."

    "  Aligning Basketball-Reference data with NBA API data is critical for seamless merging downstream. Key differences addressed include:  \n",

    "    - NBA API data provides aggregated records for players who played for multiple teams in a season.  \n",
    "    - Basketball-Reference data includes both aggregated records and individual team records for such players.\n",
    "    - NBA API data records the team a player last played for during the season in the aggregated record. In contrast, Basketball-Reference uses custom labels, such as `\"3TM\"`, to indicate that a player participated for three different teams in a single season.\n",
    "  - **Team Labels:**  \n",
    "    - Team labels differ between the datasets for certain teams (e.g., Brooklyn Nets recorded as `BRK` in Basketball-Reference and `BKN` in the NBA API).  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strong Positive Correlations:**  \n",
    "  The strong correlations between Box Plus-Minus (BPM), Win Shares per 48 Minutes (WS/48), and Player Efficiency Rating (PER) suggest that players with higher efficiency ratings tend to contribute more positively to team success.  \n",
    "  - `BPM` and `PER` (**0.89**)  \n",
    "  - `WS/48` and `BPM` (**0.87**)  \n",
    "  - `WS/48` and `PER` (**0.86**)  \n",
    "  These relationships are expected since BPM and WS/48 reflect **overall impact**, while PER measures **individual per-minute efficiency**, both of which typically align in high-performing players.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moderate Correlations:**  \n",
    "  - `Minutes Played per Game (MIN)` shares a moderate positive correlation with Total Games Played (games_played) (0.63) and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) (0.59).  \n",
    "  - This suggests that players logging more minutes per game are also more likely to play a higher total number of games across the season and accumulate a higher VORP, a cumulative impact stat.  \n",
    "  - The positive correlation between VORP and minutes played aligns with expectations, as higher total playing time naturally leads to greater cumulative contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weak or No Correlation:**  \n",
    "  - `Defensive Rating (def_rating)` shows little to no correlation with most other advanced metrics.  \n",
    "  - Interestingly, `def_rating` even has a slight negative correlation with `BPM` (0.05) suggesting that defensive contributions may not be well captured in other impact metrics.  \n",
    "  - This raises concerns that offensive performance may be weighted more heavily than defense in standard advanced stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways & Next Steps:**\n",
    "✔️ The heatmap indicates that **most advanced statistics are positively correlated with one another, except for Defensive Rating**.  \n",
    "✔️ This suggests that **offensive statistics may carry more weight** than defensive ones in their computation.  \n",
    "✔️ **To improve balance in player evaluation**:\n",
    "  - **Rebalance the weights in the composite score** to **increase the impact of defensive rating**, ensuring that defensive performance is properly rewarded in the final ranking.\n"
